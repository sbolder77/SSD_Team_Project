Use this for validating json - https://jsonlint.com/. This line can be removed once we have code done just so you can use it if you want to validate structure of json when coding. Also if you ant to see some examples of writing to, updating, deleting json look at this project i did for my first module - https://github.com/sbolder77/Portfolio/tree/main/Code/Python - look at toolkit.py. I have also addedd toolkit example.py in our solution just for reference. Again dont have to use it but as a starting point and for working with json.
